In order to obtain these features, more sophisticated model(s) with the ability to extract them from the raw pixel CIFAR-10 dataset have to be used. Once these features are available, a K-NN model or other K-NN like model can be utilized to classify them , such as the implementation by [Xu et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02733v1.pdf)."
